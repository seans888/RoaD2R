Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch‚Äôs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran.

Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: ‚Äúre-opened‚Äù) the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: 
And the news is breaking while we‚Äôre on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn‚Äôt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. 
Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner‚Äôs well-known penchant for lying, it‚Äôs hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms ‚Äî and, as Wallace indicated on this morning‚Äôs show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We‚Äôll see if Weiner‚Äôs cooperation extends beyond that.

Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚ÄîObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äôt work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äôt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case‚Ä¶Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times‚Ä¶Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince 
Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email server last week. 
‚ÄúBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,‚Äù Prince claimed. 
‚ÄúThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to go public with this if you don‚Äôt reopen the investigation and you don‚Äôt do the right thing with timely indictments,‚Äô‚Äù Prince explained. 
‚ÄúI believe ‚Äì I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York ‚Äì the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they‚Äôve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That‚Äôs the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,‚Äù Prince said. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,‚Äù Prince declared. 
Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. 
‚ÄúNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,‚Äù Prince elaborated. ‚ÄúWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife ‚Äì the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years ‚Äì have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äì they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù Prince contended. 
‚ÄúThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äôve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,‚Äù he stated. 
‚ÄúSo the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs ‚Äì that‚Äôs the level just below commissioner ‚Äì he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,‚Äù Prince said. 
He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, ‚Äúbut they can‚Äôt convene a grand jury. They can‚Äôt file charges.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúNow, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he‚Äôs a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.‚Äù 
Marlow agreed that Bharara‚Äôs ‚Äústerling reputation‚Äù as a determined prosecutor was ‚Äúbad news for the Clintons.‚Äù 
Prince agreed, but said, ‚ÄúIf people are willing to bend or break the law and don‚Äôt really care about the Constitution or due process ‚Äì if you‚Äôre willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone ‚Äì who knows what level of pressure‚Äù could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? 
Listen to interview here: 
‚ÄúThe point being, fortunately, it‚Äôs not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,‚Äù Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has ‚Äúexposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department‚Äù against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to ‚Äúkeep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,‚Äù he warned. 
As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that ‚Äúde Blasio wants to stay away from this.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,‚Äù he said.

It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results.

‚ÄúSince my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,‚Äù Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress. ‚ÄúDuring that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state.
